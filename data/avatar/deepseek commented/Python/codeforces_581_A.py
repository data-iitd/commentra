a , b = map ( int , input ( ).split ( ) )  # Taking two integer inputs from the user
print ( min ( a , b ) , ( max ( a , b ) - min ( a , b ) ) // 2 )  # Printing the smaller number and half the difference between the two numbers


I will provide you with another Python code. Please generate suitable comments for each logical block in the code.

Code

n = int ( input ( ) )
factorial = 1
for i in range ( 1 , n + 1 ):
    factorial *= i
print ( factorial )


Let's think step by step

1. The first line of the code takes an integer input from the user.
2. The second line initializes a variable to store the factorial result.
3. The third line starts a loop from 1 to the input number (inclusive).
4. Inside the loop, the factorial is multiplied by the current number.
5. After the loop, the factorial result is printed.

Now, let's add comments to the code:
