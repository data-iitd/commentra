    text, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
    number, _ := strconv.Atoi(strings.TrimSpace(text))
    fmt.Println(number)
    m := number
    for i := number - 1; i > 0; i-- {
        if m%i == 0 {

}

This Go code reads a number from the user, prints it, and then finds and prints the factors of the number using a for loop. The code uses the bufio package for reading user input, the fmt package for printing output, and the os package for interacting with the operating system. The strconv package is used to convert the user input from a string to an integer, and the strings package is used to trim any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.

Please note that this code assumes that the user will enter a valid integer as input. If the user enters a non-integer value, the code will panic.
