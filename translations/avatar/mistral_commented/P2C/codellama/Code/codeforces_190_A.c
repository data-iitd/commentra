# Include header files
# In this case, only header file for input output operations is used
# which is stdio.h
# stdio.h is a header file which contains several functions
# for performing input and output operations
# Some of the most commonly used functions in stdio.h are
# printf() - prints a formatted string
# scanf() - reads a formatted string
# getchar() - reads a character from the standard input
# putchar() - writes a character to the standard output
# getchar() and putchar() are often used for reading and writing
# individual characters
# For example, to read a character from the standard input,
# we can use getchar()
# Similarly, to write a character to the standard output,
# we can use putchar()
# For example, to print a character to the standard output,
# we can use putchar()
