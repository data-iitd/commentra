 if busDeparture >= simArrival or simDeparture >= busArrival: # Check if the bus departure or arrival time is after the simulation time
 continue # If so, skip to the next iteration of the loop
 counter += 1 # Increment the counter if the bus timing is valid

 # Write the output to the console
 print(counter) # Print the number of buses that can accommodate students

These comments should provide a clear understanding of what each part of the code does. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
