# Step 1: Import the math module.
import math

# Step 2: Read two integer values from the user and store them in variables a and b.
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

# Step 3: Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b, and store the result in variable y.
y = 2*(a+b)

# Step 4: Calculate the product of a and b, and store the result in variable x.
x = a*b

# Step 5: Display the values of x and y.
print(x,y)

# Step 6: Return 0 to indicate that the program has executed successfully.
return 0
