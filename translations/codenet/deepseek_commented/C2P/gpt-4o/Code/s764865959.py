# Step 3: Declare an integer variable x.
x = int(input())  # Step 4: Read an integer value from the user and store it in x.
x = x * x * x  # Step 5: Calculate the cube of the value stored in x.
print(x)  # Step 6: Print the result.

# Step 7: End the main function and return 0. (Not needed in Python)
