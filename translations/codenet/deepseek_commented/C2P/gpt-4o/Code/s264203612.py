# Step 2: Declare variables to store the radius, area, and circumference of the circle.
r = 0.0
s = 0.0
l = 0.0

# Step 4: Initialize the value of π (pi) to a constant.
p = 3.141592653589

# Step 5: Read the radius from the user.
r = float(input())

# Step 6: Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = π * radius^2.
s = r * r * p

# Step 7: Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula: circumference = 2 * π * radius.
l = 2 * p * r

# Step 8: Print the area and circumference of the circle.
print(f"{s} {l}")

# Step 9: Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
# In Python, we don't need to explicitly return 0.
