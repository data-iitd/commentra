	 * Step 1: Include necessary packages
	 * The Go code starts by importing the necessary packages for input/output operations and string manipulation.
	 */

	/*
	 * Step 2: Define main function
	 * The main function is the entry point of the program. It initializes variables and processes the input.
	 */

	/*
	 * Step 3: Read input
	 * The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of elements in the array.
	 * It then reads `n` integers and stores them in a slice `a`.
	 */

	/*
	 * Step 4: Process the array
	 * The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0.
	 * It iterates through the slice `a` and updates `curr` based on the condition `a[i] == curr + 1`.
	 */

	/*
	 * Step 5: Output the result
	 * If `curr` is greater than 0, it prints the number of elements that need to be removed to make the sequence continuous, which is `n - curr`.
	 * If `curr` is 0, it prints `-1` indicating that it's not possible to make the sequence continuous.
	 */

	/*
	 * Step 6: Return 0
	 * The main function returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
