# Include necessary libraries for input/output operations
# Define a constant PI for representing the value of Ï€
# Define a type alias for long long integers (not needed in Python)
# Define a macro for a loop that iterates n times (not needed in Python)
# Include additional libraries for sets (not needed in this code)

# Read two integers n and m from the standard input
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# n represents the number of items, m represents the number of items

ans = 0
# Initialize a variable to store the result, which will be the sum of combinations

# Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items (n choose 2)
ans += n * (n - 1) // 2

# The formula for n choose 2 is n * (n - 1) // 2
# Add this value to the answer

# Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 items from m items (m choose 2)
ans += m * (m - 1) // 2

# The formula for m choose 2 is m * (m - 1) // 2
# Add this value to the answer

# Output the final answer, which is the sum of combinations from n and m
print(ans)
