# Step 3: Read an integer input
n = int(input())

# Step 4: Perform a calculation
# The formula (n - 2) * 180 calculates the sum of internal angles of an n-sided polygon
print((n - 2) * 180)

# Step 5: Output the result
# The result is printed to the console

# Step 6: Return from the main function
# In Python, we simply end the script
# No explicit return is needed
