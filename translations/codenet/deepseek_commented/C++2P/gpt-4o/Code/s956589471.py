# Step 3: Declare variables to store input values
a, b, c, d, e, k = map(int, input().split())

# Step 5: Calculate the difference between e and a and check if it is less than or equal to k
print("Yay!" if e - a <= k else ":(")

# Step 7: Return 0 to indicate successful execution
# In Python, we don't need to explicitly return 0
