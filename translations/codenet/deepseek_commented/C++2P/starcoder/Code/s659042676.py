# Step 1: Import required libraries
# Use the import keyword to import the required libraries.
import math

# Step 2: Define the main function
# The main function is the entry point of the program.
def main():
    # Step 3: Declare variables
    a = 0
    b = 0

    # Step 4: Read input values
    # Use input to read input values from the user.
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    # Step 5: Perform calculations
    # Calculate the result based on the input values.
    result = 6 - a - b

    # Step 6: Output the result
    # Use print to display the result.
    print(result)

# Step 7: Check if this program runs as standalone program
# The following code is executed only when this program runs as standalone program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
