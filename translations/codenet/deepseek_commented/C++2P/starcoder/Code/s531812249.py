# Initialize a variable to store the result, which will be the sum of combinations

# Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 items from n items (n choose 2)
ans += n * (n - 1) / 2

# The formula for n choose 2 is n * (n - 1) / 2
# Add this value to the answer

# Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 items from m items (m choose 2)
ans += m * (m - 1) / 2
