# Read the number of sides of the polygon from user input
n = int(input())  # Convert the input to an integer

# Calculate the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 'n' sides
# The formula for the sum of interior angles is (n - 2) * 180
print((n - 2) * 180)  # Output the calculated sum of interior angles
