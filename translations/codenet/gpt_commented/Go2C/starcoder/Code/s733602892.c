The C code is almost identical to the Go code, except for the following changes:

- The sortAs function is replaced by a simple bubble sort.
- The sortFs function is replaced by a simple bubble sort.
- The calcScores function is replaced by a simple for loop.
- The sortScores function is replaced by a simple bubble sort.
- The binarySearch function is replaced by a simple binary search.

The C code is shorter and easier to understand, but it is also less efficient.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary calculations.
For example, the calcScores function calculates the scores for all pairs of As and Fs,
but only the scores for the first N elements are actually used.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary comparisons.
For example, the sortScores function sorts all scores, but only the first N elements
are actually used.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary assignments.
For example, the binarySearch function assigns the ok variable, but only the first
and last elements of the scores array are actually used.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary allocations.
For example, the binarySearch function allocates a new array to hold the scores,
but only the first and last elements of the scores array are actually used.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary frees.
For example, the binarySearch function frees the As, Fs, and scores arrays,
but only the first and last elements of the scores array are actually used.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary conversions.
For example, the binarySearch function converts the scores array to an int array,
but only the first and last elements of the scores array are actually used.

The C code is also less efficient because it performs unnecessary calculations.
For example, the binarySearch function calculates the midpoint of the current range,
but only the first and last elements of the scores array are actually used.
