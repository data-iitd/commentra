The C code is a bit more verbose than the Go code, but it is still readable.

The union-find structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements. Each element is in one and only one set. The set is represented by a tree structure, where each element is the root of a subtree. The tree is usually represented by a parent array, where each element points to its parent.

The union-find structure has two operations:

Find: Find the root of the element with path compression.
Union: Unite two elements into the same set.

The find operation is used to check if two elements are in the same set. The union operation is used to unite two elements into the same set.

The find operation is implemented by path compression. The idea is to make each element point directly to its root, rather than to its parent. This is done by recursively following the parent pointers until the root is found.

The union operation is implemented by rank. The idea is to make each set have the same height. This is done by making the root of the smaller tree point to the root of the larger tree.
