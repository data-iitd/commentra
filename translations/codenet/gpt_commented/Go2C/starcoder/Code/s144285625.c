The C code above is a simple implementation of the selection sort algorithm. The sort_triplets function sorts a slice of triplets in ascending order. The main function first reads the number of groups of three integers from the command line. Then, it initializes a slice to hold 3*n integers. It then populates the slice with integers from the command line. Finally, it sorts the slice of integers in ascending order. The main function then calculates the sum of the second largest integer from each group of three.
