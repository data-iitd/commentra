# Declare variables to hold two integers and their average
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the average of the two integers
n = (a + b) // 2

# Print the calculated average
print(n)

# Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program
# In Python, we don't need to explicitly return 0
