# Declare integer variables to hold the input values and results

# Read two integer values from user input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the area of a rectangle (length * width)
c = a * b

# Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle (2 * (length + width))
d = 2 * a + 2 * b

# Output the calculated area and perimeter
print(c, d)

# Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program
# (Not needed in Python, as the program ends naturally)
