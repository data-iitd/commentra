# <START-OF-CODE>

# Declare variables to hold the lengths of the two bases (a and b) and the height (h)
a = 0
b = 0
h = 0

# Read the values of the two bases and the height from user input
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
h = int(input())

# Calculate the area of the trapezoid using the formula: Area = ((base1 + base2) * height) / 2
# and print the result
print((a + b) * h / 2)
