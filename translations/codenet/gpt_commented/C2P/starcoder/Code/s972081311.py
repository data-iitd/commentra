# <START-OF-CODE>

# Declare variables to hold the input number and the sum
n = 0
sum = 0

# Read an integer input from the user
n = int(input())

# Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula n*(n+1)/2
sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2

# Print the calculated sum to the console
print(sum)
