# Start of the main function
a, b = map(int, input().split())  # Read two integers from the standard input and store them in variables a and b

x = 2 * a + 2 * b  # Multiply variables a and b by 2, and then add the results together and store the result in variable x
y = a * b  # Multiply variables a and b and store the result in variable y

print(y, x)  # Print the values of variables y and x to the standard output, separated by a space

# Indicate that the main function has run successfully and terminate the program
