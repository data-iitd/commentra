# Include the standard input output library

# Declare the main function

# Read four integers from the standard input and store them in variables a, b, c, and d

# Declare variables a, b, c, d, i, and j

# Multiply variables a and b and store the result in variable i

# Multiply variables c and d and store the result in variable j

# Check if the value of i is greater than j

# If true, print the value of i

# If the condition in the if statement is false

# Print the value of j

# End the main function with a return value of 0
