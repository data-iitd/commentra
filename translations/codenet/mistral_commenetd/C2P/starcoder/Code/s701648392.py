# Include the standard input/output library header file

# Declare three integer variables: a, b, and c

# Use the scanf function to read three integers from the standard input
# and assign them to the variables a, b, and c respectively

# If the condition a < b and b < c is true, print the string "Yes"
# followed by a newline character to the standard output

# If the condition a < b and b < c is false, print the string "No"
# followed by a newline character to the standard output

# End the main function with a return statement of 0, indicating that
# the program has run successfully
