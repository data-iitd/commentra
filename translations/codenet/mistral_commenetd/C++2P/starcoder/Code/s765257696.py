# Define the data type long long and alias it as ll

# Define a constant for the modulus value

# Read an integer n from the standard input

# Allocate an array p of size n to store the input integers

# Initialize the variable ans to 0

# Iterate through the array p from index 0 to n-3

# Check if the current element p[i] is smaller than the next two elements p[i+1] and p[i+2]

# Check if the current element p[i] is greater than the next two elements p[i+1] and p[i+2]

# Print the value of ans to the standard output

# Return 0 from the main function to indicate successful execution
