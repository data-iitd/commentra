# The simple substitution cipher is a cipher that has been in use for many
# hundreds of years (an excellent history is given in Simon Singhs 'the Code
# Book'). It basically consists of substituting every plaintext character for a
# different ciphertext character. It differs from the Caesar cipher in that the
# cipher alphabet is not simply the alphabet shifted, it is completely jumbled.
