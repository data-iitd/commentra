print('Christmas'+' Eve'*abs(int(input())-25))
# The code starts by taking an integer input from the user.
# This input is used to determine how many times the string 'Eve' should be repeated.
# The absolute value of the difference between the input and 25 is calculated.
# The string 'Eve' is repeated the calculated number of times.
# Finally, 'Christmas' is concatenated with the repeated 'Eve' and the result is printed.
